# Product preview card design

## Overview
A product preview card example built using HTML & CSS. I've created this as part of Frontend Mentor's challenge that you can find [here](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/product-preview-card-component-GO7UmttRfa).

You can visit the live site on

The design of the card is responsive for both desktop and mobile screen sizes. Feel free to resize the window to see the changes.

## My process

### Built with

- HTML5 with semantic markup
- CSS Grid and Flexbox
- CSS Variables
- Custom fonts


### What I learned
- Starting to familiarize myself with CSS grid, after being only used to flex-based grid systems from frameworks like Bootstrap. Hopefully I can utilize this more in future projects.
- I've paid more attention to more HTML semantic properties to improve accessibility.
- I've just realized that Github Pages is very useful to simply deploy client-side projects in just one touch.
